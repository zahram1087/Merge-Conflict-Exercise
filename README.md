# Merge-Conflict-Exercise
Review the workflow on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice and try to identify all of the individual things that they did wrong AND all of the things that they should have done but failed to do. Write up descriptions of those things and put those into the README of the repo.

Issues:
1. Git pull origin master was not applied to the branches on each local terminal. Work was continued to be doneo on the branches of each individual local terminal. Merge conclicts were then caused by eahc branch work when an individual tried to push git origin master. 

2. Resolution: Make sure that each local terminal has the latest version of the master branch and creating a new local branch to work on individually.
